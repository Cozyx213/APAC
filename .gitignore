# --- Editor/IDE specific files ---

# --- Git Submodule (if applicable) ---
# The .gitmodules file itself SHOULD NOT be ignored.
# Git manages the content within the submodule's directory based on the submodule's repo.
# You might occasionally ignore specific temporary files *within* a submodule if its own .gitignore doesn't cover them,
# but usually, that should be handled by the submodule's own .gitignore.

# If you need to ignore the entire submodule directory for some reason (rare), use the folder name:
# app-frontend/ # Uncomment this line ONLY if you absolutely need to ignore the submodule directory itself, which is unusual.
